This directory contains a listing of monthly notes for Ian Joynes.  
Currently, these notebooks are written in markdown.  However, they may 
be converted to latex to accommodate mathematical formulae.  The 
expected benefits of this method of note taking are:

- Searchable record  
- Accessible from any location  
- Paperless  
- Backed-up  
- Revision history  

This is a trial method for keeping records, and may change in the 
future.
