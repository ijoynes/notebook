This directory contains a listing of my monthly notes. Currently, these notebooks are written in markdown.  However, they may be converted to latex to accommodate mathematical formulae.  The expected benefits of this method of note taking are:

- Searchable record  
- Accessible from any location  
- Paperless  
- Backed-up  
- Revision history  

This is a trial method for keeping records, and may change in the 
future.
