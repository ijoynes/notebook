##To-Do List
[ ] Find out what "sequential" in the context of a statistical method 
      means  
[ ] Find out what "variational" in the context of an optimization 
      method means  
[ ] Why is a fluid parcel that a pathline tracks not infinitely small.  
      Is it because of diffusion into and out of the parcel?  Can a
      single pathline model diffusion?  
[ ] Reorganize the data that is now on the external hard drive.  
[ ] Ask Amir is he has a reference for his comment "Turbulent diffusion 
      poses a more serious problem in LMs as they donâ€™t account for 
      diffusion in and out of the parcel. This could cause significant 
      error in high resolution or close to large sources."

- Added discussion on the Ensemble Kalman filter and Extended Kalman 
    filter.  
- Found an excellent resource on the ensemble Kalman filter.  
- [Data Assimilation by Geir Evensen](http://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/book/978-3-642-03710-8)  
- Data Assimilate is used to estimate the current state and predict 
    future states, such as numerical weather prediction.  
- Parameter estimation determines the model inputs that give an 
    expected response.  
- Set up automatic back-up to the groups backup server
- Currently only backing up my GitHub directory

- Got an external hard drive from Johnson to back up CFD data and free 
    up space on linux j_group  
- Currently copying files off of linux j_group to external hard drive  
- Need to sort through all files on external hard drive and on my 
    computer and organize better  
- What does sequential mean?  How does it replace my "statistical" term?
- What does variational mean?  How does it replace my "optimization" 
    term?  

## 2013-07-06
- Cleaned up the Lagrangian Back-Trajectory Methods section
- Worked on combining GA and SA into a single global optimization method
- Implemented a 1 variable bayesian inference demonstration
