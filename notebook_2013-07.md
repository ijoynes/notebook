##To-Do List
[x] Find out what "sequential" in the context of a statistical method 
      means  

- "Sequential" methods “use a probabilistic framework and give 
   estimates of the whole system state sequentially by propagating 
   information only forward in time” ([Bertion et al., 2003](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1403885)).  

[x] Find out what "variational" in the context of an optimization 
      method means:  

- "Variational" means that an objective function is minimized.  

[ ] Why is a fluid parcel that a pathline tracks not infinitely small.  
      Is it because of diffusion into and out of the parcel?  Can a
      single pathline model diffusion?  
[ ] Reorganize the data that is now on the external hard drive.  
[ ] Ask Amir is he has a reference for his comment "Turbulent diffusion 
      poses a more serious problem in LMs as they don’t account for 
      diffusion in and out of the parcel. This could cause significant 
      error in high resolution or close to large sources."

- Added discussion on the Ensemble Kalman filter and Extended Kalman 
    filter.  
- Found an excellent resource on the ensemble Kalman filter.  
- [Data Assimilation by Geir Evensen](http://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/book/978-3-642-03710-8)  
- Data Assimilate is used to estimate the current state and predict 
    future states, such as numerical weather prediction.  
- Parameter estimation determines the model inputs that give an 
    expected response.  
- Set up automatic back-up to the groups backup server
- Currently only backing up my GitHub directory


##2013-07-05
- Got an external hard drive from Johnson to back up CFD data and free 
    up space on linux j_group  
- Currently copying files off of linux j_group to external hard drive  
- Need to sort through all files on external hard drive and on my 
    computer and organize better  
- What does sequential mean?  How does it replace my "statistical" term?
- What does variational mean?  How does it replace my "optimization" 
    term?  

## 2013-07-06
- Cleaned up the Lagrangian Back-Trajectory Methods section
- Worked on combining GA and SA into a single global optimization method
- Implemented a 1 variable bayesian inference demonstration

## 2013-07-08
- Finished transfering all files off of the linux j_group
- Researched the 3 major catagories of data assimilation: Optimal interpolation, sequential and variational
- Optimal interpolation tries to fit a smooth function through the observations
- Sequential DA “use a probabilistic framework and give 
   estimates of the whole system state sequentially by propagating 
   information only forward in time” ([Bertion et al., 2003](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1403885)). 
- Variational DA formulates an objective function is minimized.  
- I am assuming that DA is for estimating the state of the system, while parameter estimate determines the model inputs such as a forcing function (emission source)

**Qualifications**  
 
An advanced degree in mechanical engineering or physical sciences from a university of recognized standing.
Knowledge of basic machine design practices, strength of materials and basic manufacturing techniques.
Knowledge of technologies outside of traditional mechanical design would be an asset as would experience in robotics, automation and remote tooling.
Candidates are expected to possess general computer literacy in word processing and a high degree of expertise with spreadsheet software as well as some experience with design software packages.
The successful candidate is expected to have good practical problem solving skills.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills are essential for this position as the successful candidate will be expected to prepare research proposals, author papers and reports and deliver presentations.
The ability to communicate and negotiate with external and internal customers and suppliers is an asset.
The successful candidate for this position will have good organizational skills, be versatile and adaptable and be able to work in a team environment.
A good work ethic is a must.
Eligibility for membership in Professional Engineers of Ontario is an asset.
AECL has an Employment Equity Program and encourages applications from women, Aboriginal Peoples, visible minorities and persons with disabilities.
